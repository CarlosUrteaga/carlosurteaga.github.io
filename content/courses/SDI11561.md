## Objectives
By the end of the lab, students will be able to:

* Understand the differences between an FPGA and a microcontroller.
* Implement a digital system with basic perception and action capabilities.
* Understand different communication methods/protocols for connecting digital systems.

## Skills to Develop During the Semester

Throughout the lab, students will:

* Design and develop digital systems that integrate sensors and actuators.
* Implement digital systems using a hardware description language (HDL).
* Analyze, diagnose, and debug digital systems using verification techniques.
* Collaborate effectively in teams to solve an engineering problem.
