## Objectives

By the end of the lab, students will be able to:

* Understand the differences between an FPGA and a microcontroller.
* Develop a minimal computing system using a field-programmable gate array.
* Program combinational logic circuits to integrate sensors and actuators.
* Implement a digital system with basic perception and action capabilities.
* Understand different communication methods/protocols for connecting digital systems.


## Skills to Develop During the Semester

Throughout the lab, students will:

* Design and implement digital systems using combinational logic circuits.
* Design and develop digital systems that integrate sensors and actuators.
* Implement digital systems using a hardware description language (HDL).
* Analyze, identify, and resolve issues in digital systems using verification techniques.
* Work collaboratively in teams to solve an engineering problem.
