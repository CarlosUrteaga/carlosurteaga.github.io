# Abstract

The rapid adoption of LLM-based agents raises new challenges for transparency, reproducibility, and governance. Existing artifacts (Model Cards, Data Sheets) document models and data, but there is no standard for the operational characteristics of agents. We introduce Agent Cards, a lightweight artifact that captures roles, memory, tool integrations, communication protocols, monitoring hooks, governance scope, and evaluation metrics. Standardized descriptions make agents transparent, comparable, and auditable across deployments. We provide a template, an illustrative example, and guidance for integrating Agent Cards into MLOps/LLMOps practices. We argue that Agent Cards can underpin future work on agent ledgers, audit bundles, and maturity frameworks, giving practitioners and researchers a shared vocabulary for responsible operationalization of agentic AI.

## Proposed Agent Card Template

| **Section**        | **Description** |
|---|---|
| **Agent version**  | Semantic version of the agent release (e.g., 1.2) |
| **Agent Name**     | Identifier of the agent. |
| **Agent Role(s)**  | Planner, Executor, Critic, Orchestrator (list specific roles). |
| **Inputs**         | Text files, APIs, structured and unstructured data. |
| **Outputs**        | API responses or text. |
| **Memory**         | Short-term: current turn/context window profile, Long-term. |
| **Tools/Functions**| Capabilities the agent can invoke beyond its core LLM (calculators, retrieval, external APIs, spreadsheets, domain tools). Include type, purpose, and how it extends abilities. |
| **Communication**  | Human interface (chat/UI); agent-to-agent protocols; message schemas/versions; handoff/approval policies. |
| **Monitoring**     | Logged metrics (latency, token usage, error rate); trace IDs; inference profile/feature flags; SLOs and alert routes. |
| **Governance**     | Safety filters/guardrails; PII/PHI handling; data retention and access control; approvals and audit checkpoints. |
| **Versioning**     | Release tag/date; prompt hash; toolchain/SBOM; external dependency versions; overall reproducibility hash. |
| **Known Limitations** | Scope boundaries; partial automation notes; brittleness/non-determinism sources (e.g., upstream API variability). |
| **Evaluation**     | Benchmarks/KPIs (e.g., RAG quality, long-context stress); calibration/abstention policy; evaluation datasets/snapshots; last run date and results. |

abstract="The rapid adoption of large language models (LLMs) into AI agents has created new challenges for transparency, reproducibility, and governance. While prior artifacts such as Model Cards and Data Sheets for Datasets support documentation of models and data, no analogous standard exists for describing the operational characteristics of AI agents. This paper introduces Agent Cards, a structured documentation artifact designed to capture the essential attributes of an agent, including its roles, memory taxonomy, tool integrations, communication protocols, monitoring hooks, governance scope, and evaluation metrics. By standardizing how agents are described, Agent Cards provide a lightweight yet powerful mechanism for enabling transparency, comparability, and auditability across deployments. A template is presented, accompanied by an illustrative example, followed by a discussion of the benefits of adopting Agent Cards within broader MLOps and LLMOps practices.
