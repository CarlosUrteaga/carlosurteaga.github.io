Applied & Data Scientist, Machine & Deep Learning Engineer, Analytics, IoT, Computer Vision, Python, Robotics, IA, BI 
Carlos is a Ph.D. student and Data Scientist and ML Engineer who has been involved in different sectors such as Financial, Education, Retail, and Telecommunication for more than nine years. He has played a crucial role as MLOps engineer, where he deployed pipelines for integration, training and prediction using different architecture approaches to follow up model performance. Carlos has a strong foundation in computer science and machine learning. In addition, he played as a research assistant for a leading University in the development of AI algorithms for pattern recognition and robotics using computer vision.


Currently he leads an MLOps squad to standardize different tools and practices to create a federation of models and resources. 

Education
======

* Ph.D. in Computer Science, UNADE, (expected 2026)
* M.S. in Computer Science, ITAM, 2017
* B.S. in Telematics Engineer, ITAM, 2015

Work experience summarized
======
* March 2019: Data Scientist advisor
  * Implement Github migration  using API and PythonGit
  * Design a recommended system for technical interview matcher with Python, sklearn and flask. This accelerate the interview schedule from 3 days to 1 day.
  * Implement a data pipeline to enhance the quality of data extraction using regular expression. The quality was improved 80% when the data is incompleated.
  * Develop an AI solution for face recognition and people counting using Deep Learning on Python with Keras, and flask. The obtained performance was 90% from a company with more than 330,000 employees.
  * Perform a Data-driven discovery to minimize cost for the IT area. The estimated saving cost was 25\% for each celular bill.
  * Create a machine learning model to detect domestic violence for Uruguay, Brazil, and Honduras, the model is able to detect the 82 recidivism case from 100 on each period.
