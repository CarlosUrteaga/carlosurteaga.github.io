I'm data scientist and entrepreneur. I like to improve models of classification using behavior with historical records. My main language for modeling is Python and favority platform  is SMACK. Today I'm working in a Financial institute to detect customer behavior. Today I increase the score in 15 points.  Beside, I worked as lecturer teaching robotics and computer networks.
