In the last years, I have been working as Data Scientist solving data problems through the ingestion to implementation. I enjoy analyzing and describing changes on the records on each update, this allow me  to understand the problem and the data deeply.  Also, I have been working with computer vision to improve the current solution in buildings

Today I'm analyzing the data quality of COVID19 in Mexico city https://github.com/CarlosUrteaga/COVID19MX
