Applied & Data Scientist, Machine & Deep Learning Engineer, Analytics, IoT, Computer Vision, Python, Robotics, IA, BI 

In the last years, I have been working as DS where I design and perform machine learning models for predictions and detection using Python. Today Iâ€™m working in Globant as Data Scientist. Beside, I has worked as lecturer teaching robotics and computer networks. I start to analyze the data quality of the covid cases in Mexico City.



Education
======
* Diplom in Applied Machine Learning, 2019
* M.S. in Computer Science, ITAM, 2017
* B.S. in Telematics Engineer, ITAM, 2015

Work experience
======
* Mar 2019: Data Scientist 
  * Propose and design MLOps (Machine Learning Operations) flow to monitoring and retrain a ML model. This set the baseline that was adapted to other projects.
  * Lead a multidisciplinary team with Kanban to predict seniority using demographic information and the resume.. The ML model is a staking model and uses streaming data through multithread. Tools used were Celery, Python, Flask, Docker.
  * Design an architecture to transform a Jupyter notebook to productive REST API, the API were delivered one month before expected including quality test.
  * Implement a data pipeline to extract information from point of sales with different data type.s The pipeline allows to detect 50 % new products using Python on a GCP platform.
  * Develop an AI solution for face recognition and people counting using Deep Learning on Python with Keras, and flask. The obtained performance was 90 % from a company with more than 330,000 employees.
  * Perform a Data-driven discovery to minimize cost for the IT area. The estimated saving cost was 25% for each celular bill
  * Create a machine learning model to detect domestic violence for Uruguay, Brazil, and Honduras, the model is able to detect the 82 recidivism case from 100 on each period.
  * Translate business requirements into machine learning product for international clients, such as Scoring, AI Call Analyzer and HR Chatbot.
  * Generated universal dashboard to evaluate marketing activities using Tableau, presenting results in less than a week.

* Sept 2018: Head of Data Science 
  * Generation of models of custumer to target marketing targets
  * USING NLP and NLQ to improve internal process
  * Focus the innovation using AI, ML and IoT

* May 2018: Sr. Data Science
  * Customer behavior detection from IVR dataset
  * Dashboard for Marketing Activities
  
* Oct 2017: Sr of Information Security
  * Management of users a national level to waranty a follow of IT policies, this is accomplishment using python and Machine Learning (Random Forest)
  * Data analyst for compliance and monthly report of computer status to report unauthorized behavior. 
  * Manage and report Information Security incident to KPMG Global

* Ago 2017: Research Assistant
  * Proposed and present of Research and Advisory on Fraud, Mobility, Health, Telecommunications, etc.
  * Analyze and promoted distributed systems solutions with HDFS, Hadoop, SPARK and Pig, multiples POCs was realized.
