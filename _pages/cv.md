Applied & Data Scientist, Machine & Deep Learning Engineer, Analytics, IoT, Computer Vision, Python, Robotics, IA, BI 

In the last years, I have been working as DS where I design and perform machine learning models for predictions and detection using Python. Today Iâ€™m working in Globant as advisor. Beside, I worked as lecturer teaching robotics and computer networks. I start to analyze the data quality of the covid cases in Mexico City.

Today I'm analyzing the data quality of COVID19 in Mexico city https://github.com/CarlosUrteaga/COVID19MX
