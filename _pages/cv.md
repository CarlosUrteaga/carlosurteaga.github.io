    * Data Flow Pipeline for Candidate Evaluation: Engineered a data flow pipeline to extract, import, and evaluate candidate information for optimal studio placements. Employed ensemble models—such as KNN and random forest—to mitigate data inconsistencies and improve overall robustness.
    * Talent Acquisition Model: Designed a comprehensive Talent Acquisition model aimed at efficiently matching interviewers with evaluators. Utilized intelligent scheduling techniques by analyzing calendar availability, accounting for time zones and language restrictions, which resulted in significant time savings.
    * MLOps for Talent Acquisition: Proposed and implemented an MLOps task to monitor and optimize the efficiency of the Talent Acquisition model. Incorporated queue management for streamlined operations and led a team in adopting industry best practices using MLFlow and ArgoFlow for comprehensive tracking and optimization.

    * Pipeline & ETL Development: Developed robust pipelines to extract, clean, and transform data in line with industry product masters, including feature selection. Created an ETL process to ingest data from multiple formats (XML, JSON, CSV) into a centralized data lake.
    * API & Environment Setup: Deployed Flask-based APIs to integrate various data sources and enhance data completeness. Configured a Docker container on a GCP Compute Engine VM to create a productive environment for data extraction.
    * Quality Improvement: Implemented a data extraction pipeline using regular expressions that improved data quality by 80% in cases of incomplete data (using Python, pandas, scikit-learn, and Docker).
    * Field Identification & Reporting: Standardized industry product master fields through regular expression matching and dynamically generated demographic reports from each Point of Sale (PoS).
    * Python and Dask Workshop: Led a workshop on Python and Dask, highlighting the advantages and limitations of Dask for various projects.
    * Face Recognition & People Counting: Developed an AI solution for face recognition and people counting using deep learning with minimal image data. The solution included data augmentation, face recognition/identification, and object tracking, and was deployed as a real-time web service (video and text) using Python, TensorFlow, Keras, and Flask.
